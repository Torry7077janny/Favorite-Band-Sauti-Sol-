<h1>About Chimano</h1>
<p> Chimano was born and bred in Nairobi. He is the third born in a family of four (two boys and two girls).
     His parents gave him the best although he had a difficult childhood as an introvert. 
     Growing up, he felt like an awkward child as he didn’t like to play like other kids; instead, he loved to watch other kids play. 
     His parents were devout Christians who were strict on routine prayers which were done every evening. Chimano attended Kakamega high school and Upper hill school for his secondary studies. He later joined the University of Nairobi where he graduated with a degree in Journalism and Media Studies. 
     Willis Chimano met his bandmates Savara Mudigi and Bien Baraza in high school. After completing high school, Polycarp who went to Strathmore school joined in to complete the group. The group initially formed as an acapella and later as it gained an audience it transitioned to Afro-pop music. Also, their initial group name was ‘Sauti’ (Swahili word which means sound), and later they added ‘Sol’ (Spanish word which means sun). The ultimate name Sauti Sol was supposed to mean ‘voices in the sun.’

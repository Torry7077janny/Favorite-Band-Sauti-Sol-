        <h1> About Sauti sol</h1>        
        <p>Sauti sol is one of my favorite kenyan bands and i really love to listen and enjoy their music because it is so relatable always motivates me through the messages in the song and they are the best representation our countries culture language and traditon.Here are links to some of my favorite sauti sol songs.
    Sauti sol is a kenyan band consisting of four band members Bien-Aime Baraza,Willis Chimmano and Savara mudigi,and their guitarist Polycrap Otieno. They started singing back then in 2005  and have been active till date.Their first album is called Mwanzo and it was released on 1st November 2008.The band has had several successful tours in africa and Europe,topped kenyan charts and gained international attention with shows in Europe  and the USA as well as television apearances and as well as television appearances and various accolades and nominations including their  their 2011 concert performance in kenya with south africa a accapella group.
            Formed in Nairobi in 2005, the initial trio of high school friends Bien-Aim√© Baraza, Willis Chimano, and Savara Mudigi began as an a cappella group before introducing guitarist Polycarp Otieno into the mix. Taking on the name Sauti Sol ("Sauti" being the Swahili word for sound and "Sol" the Spanish word for sun), they participated in a local competition that earned them a spot on a 2006 compilation and a deal with Penya Records. After all four members graduated from college, Sauti Sol recorded their debut album, Mwanzo, in 2009. Its eclectic mix included romantic odes, political protest songs, and sunny paeans to the natural beauty of their home and earned the group a significant fan base around East Africa. Sol Filosofia followed in 2011 and earned the band a pair of Kisima Music Awards. A 2012 collaborative EP with South Africa's Spoek Mathambo increased their visibility, as did the controversial 2014 single "Nishike," whose sexually explicit video was banned by numerous Kenyan television stations. It appeared on their expansive 2015 release Live and Die in Afrika, which was the first on their own Sauti Sol Entertainment label
